# Libft Project 📚
My first C programming project at 42, serving as a cornerstone for future coding endeavors.

## What is it?
A custom C library containing functions implemented from scratch, 
mimicking standard C library functions and including additional utilities.

## Why is it useful?
1. Deepens understanding of C functions
2. Provides a custom, well-understood toolkit
3. Serves as a foundation for future projects

## What you can expect to find in it 🔍
- Standard Library Mimics (e.g. `ft_strncpy`, `ft_strlen`, `ft_memcpy`)
- Memory Management (e.g. `ft_calloc`, `ft_memset`)
- String Manipulation (e.g. `ft_split`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_strtrim`)
- Character Operations (e.g. `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_toupper`)
- File Descriptor Functions (e.g. `ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd`)

## 'Libft.a' - My personal touch 🎨
Once the project finished I decided to create a static library containing all my functions: libft.a.
Thus:
- you can link `libft.a` to any future project
- your tried-and-tested functions are always nearby
- no need to recompile these functions for every project, they're ready to go

## How to Use ⚙️
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `make` to compile the library
3. Link `libft.a` with your future projects

Hope you enjoy!
